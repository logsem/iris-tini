<h1>POPL21 Artifact Evaluation</h1>

<p>This document contains instructions for the artifact evaluation reviewers when
evaluating this Coq development.</p>

<h2>Inspecting the development</h2>

<p>The modal weakest precondition theory is standalone and available in the
<a href="vendor/modal_weakestpre/theories">vendor/modal_weakestpre/theories</a> folder.
The logical relations model for proving noninterference is available in the
<a href="theories">theories</a> folder.</p>

<p>The artifact comes with pre-compiled coqdoc documentation accessible through
<a href="doc.html">doc.html</a>. This document also contains a mapping of the definitions,
examples, and results from the paper to the Coq development.</p>

<h2>Building the development</h2>

<p>We recommend compiling the development using Docker. To do this,</p>

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have <a href="https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/">Docker</a> installed.</li>
<li>Run <code>make docker-build</code> to build the Docker image.</li>
</ol>

<p>Optionally, you can follow this by executing <code>docker run -i -t
iris-tini-compile</code> to start a container with the freshly built image and access
an interactive shell inside it.</p>

<p>For further information, including how to build the development manually, see
<a href="README.md">README.md</a>.</p>

<h2>Troubleshooting</h2>

<p>In order to build the development, you might have to increase the amount of
memory allocated to a running Docker container. We suggest 4GB. For
instructions, see
<a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44533319/how-to-assign-more-memory-to-docker-container">here</a>.</p>
